This is a project for CS480 Software Engineering. An Android chess game with 2 players.

The program should play on a portable device (tablet or phone, any platform).
The program will display the chess grid and pieces. It doesn't sophisticated, it can be just a flat board with 2D images for the pieces.
The player moves pieces either by touching a piece and then touching the destination square, or by dragging the piece. Either way, the piece is moved only if the move is valid. Otherwise, an 'Invalid move' message appears.
If a move results in a 'check', a message and a cue sound will indicate so. Same for a 'check-mate'.
When an user makes a move, the board is rotated so that the next player had a forward view of the board -- no need to rotated the device.
The program must provide an option to save and later reload an unfinished game.
